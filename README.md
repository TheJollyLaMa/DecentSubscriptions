    python -m http.server public

    Then, open your browser and go to http://localhost:8000.

    Alternatively, you can use any other HTTP server like Node.js or VS Code Live Server.
    npx http-server public

## üñåÔ∏è How to Make CSS Changes

	2.	Find the section you‚Äôd like to modify. For example, to update the subscription button‚Äôs glow effect, look for:
.subscription-button:hover {
box-shadow: 0 0 30px #0f0, 0 0 60px #0f0, 0 0 90px #0f0;
}
	3.	Save the file and refresh your browser to see the changes.

### 3. Update the Frontend
	1.	After deploying, copy your contract address.
	2.	Open contract.js in the public/scripts/ folder.
	3.	Replace the contractAddress variable with your new contract address:
const contractAddress = ‚Äú‚Äù;
